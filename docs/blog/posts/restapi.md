The developers at RaspAP have recently [rolled out](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/pull/1519) a new [RestAPI](https://docs.raspap.com/restapi/) based on the ultra-quick [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. Support for an API has ranked high among requests from RaspAP’s users for quite some time. To mark this occasion (and also celebrate [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day)) we’re hosting a friendly challenge to see what kinds of creative applications developers can bake up with our brand-spanking-new RestAPI.

## Judging criteria
In terms of possible applications, anything goes. Points will be awarded by the judges for apps that are original, polished, visually appealing and have real-world utility. Integrations with other popular open source projects are a big plus.

## Prizes
Prizes, you ask? Why, yes of course. To make things interesting, we’ll be giving away **lifetime [Insiders](https://docs.raspap.com/insiders/)** access to the **top three entries**, plus **$50** to cover pi(e) and coffee expenses. See what we did there?

## Rules
The rules are straightforward:

1. All code must have an open source license and be publicly available.
2. One prize awarded per developer or team.
3. Multiple entries may be submitted. If selected, the best entry will be awarded (see #2).
4. Submit your entry by posting a link in the comments below.

## Getting started
Our [docs](https://docs.raspap.com/restapi/) have everything you need to get started. The RESTful API Challenge runs for 30 days, ending April 14th, 2024. Winners will be announced via this blog, [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/discussions), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/RaspAP), [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVAsaAR) and [X](https://x.com/rasp_ap).
