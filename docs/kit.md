## A powerful router in seconds
The RaspAP Kit AX1800 adapter delivers dual-band WiFi-6 with blazing USB 3.0 speeds—up to 8-10x faster than the Raspberry Pi 4B's onboard wireless.

No guesswork, no drivers to install or configuration changes required. Simply connect the included Ethernet cable, attach the adapter to a USB 3.0 port and insert the SD card. On first boot you get wireless performance that won't bottleneck your network.

The 32GB microSD card comes preloaded with RaspAP's 64-bit firmware, running on the latest Debian 13 "trixie" OS. You get instant access to:

- Network-wide ad blocking
- VPN protection for every device
- A suite of optional plugins
- Ample shared network storage
- Complete control over your wireless network
- A full Linux OS ready to customize

!!! tip "Compatibility"
    To make the most of the AX1800 adapter, the RaspAP Kit is compatible with Raspberry Pi 4B and 5 models with USB 3.0 ports.

## Hardware components
The RaspAP Kit includes everything you need to transform your Pi 4B / 5 into a capable wireless router:

1. AX1800 USB wireless adapter – dual-band, USB 3.0, full Linux support
2. 32GB microSD card – preloaded with 64-bit RaspAP firmware

## FAQ

### What else do I need?
- A Raspberry Pi model 4B or 5
- An official power supply: 5V/3A for Pi 4, 27W for Pi 5

### Which Pi model should I use?
The Raspberry Pi model 4B (about $35) has a capable CPU and USB 3.0, which is perfect for this application. The Raspberry Pi 5 pushes speeds 2-3x faster and is also fully supported.

### Will other devices work?
Other Pi models will still work, but are limited to USB 2.0. The USB 2.0 standard is significantly slower and will create a bottleneck in your wireless router.

### How does it compare?
This depends on pricing and availability in your area, but consider that a 2GB Raspberry Pi 5 retails for around $50 USD / €55-65. The RaspAP Kit is projected to retail for around $37 USD / €32. The combined package gives you a complete, customizable Linux router with a more powerful CPU at roughly the same price as many commercial "travel" type routers.
