This is possible due in large part to these devices being built with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) customized for tasks such as these, in addition to routing packets and performing all the other functions of a typical router.</p> <p>By contrast, the Raspberry Pi family of devices use general-purpose ARM processors. This gives them much greater versatility, allowing the same hardware to serve many different purposes based solely on the software it runs. The tradeoff, of course, is performance when compared with an ASIC-based device.</p> <p>A central goal for this implementation, therefore, is to strike a balance between real-time feedback and resource efficiency.

First, the monitored interface is set by passing a value for the first argument (<code>*iface = argv[1]</code>). The interface value is then used in <code>read_interface_bytes()</code> to fetch the current TX/RX byte values. From there, it\u2019s a simple matter of calculating the difference from the previous ones.</p> <p>The second item of interest is the location this value is written to, and how it\u2019s done. <code>/dev/shm/</code> is a temporary file storage (tmpfs) that resides in RAM. In this context, \u201cshm\u201d is a reference to shared memory. You can see it on your system with mount or df, like so: <pre><code>$ df -h /dev/shm\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\ntmpfs           454M   16K  454M   1% /dev/shm\n</code></pre> Originally designed for inter-process communication (IPC), <code>/dev/shm/</code> is often used for temporary high-speed files (e.g., logs, metrics), RAM-based caching and named memory blocks for C/C++ or other low-level programs. Read/write operations are extremely fast with almost no I/O latency, making it ideal for this application. The contents of tmpfs are lost on reboots, but this isn\u2019t a concern.</p> <p>Finally, in Bash one could simply use <code>echo \"$total_diff\" &gt; \"$TMPFILE\"</code> to write out to tmpfs. However, due to timing issues, the file can be read mid-write (i.e., during echo in the shell script). On the front-end, this will often return an error such as <code>ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH 200 (OK)</code>. Even if the response returns <code>200 OK</code>, the browser will throw an error because the response body didn\u2019t match the declared length.</p> <p>The solution is to instead write automically with a temp file and use <code>mv</code>. This is done in Bash like so: <pre><code>tmpfile=$(mktemp /dev/shm/net_activity.XXXXXX)\necho \"$total_diff\" &gt; \"$tmpfile\"\nchmod 644 \"$tmpfile\"\nmv \"$tmpfile\" \"$TMPFILE\"\n</code></pre> Why does this work? The <code>mv</code> operation updates directory entries (inodes) which is a single, quick operation at the filesystem level. Atomicity refers to its all-or-nothing execution; there\u2019s no intermediate state where the operation is partially complete. This ensures that the file is never in a partially written state.</p>"},{"location":"blog/building-a-realtime-network-traffic-led-indicator/#step-3-create-a-systemd-service","title":"Step 3: Create a systemd service","text":"<p>In this step, a systemd unit file is created to autostart the script on boot.

That is, these services typically run as a non-privileged user (for example, \u2018www-data\u2019) with limited permissions. For security reasons, this user only has read access to the web root directory and its subdirectories.</p> <p>This means that attempts to access files like <code>/dev/shm/net_activity</code> will result in a permissions error. There\u2019s an easy fix for this, though. The file may be symlinked to a web-accessible path, like so: <pre><code>$ sudo ln -sf /dev/shm/net_activity /var/www/html/app/net_activity\n</code></pre> A potential downside here is this exposes an internal system path to the web. In this case, it\u2019s a file under our direct control that only contains a single integer value. As a rule of thumb, this method should only be used if the symlinked file is read-only and doesn\u2019t contain sensitive info.</p> <p>With this done, JavaScript, PHP or indeed any language enabled by the web server can access this file from within the web root.</p>"},{"location":"blog/building-a-realtime-network-traffic-led-indicator/#step-5-more-polling-javascript","title":"Step 5: More polling (JavaScript)","text":"<p>Moving to the front-end, a JavaScript handler uses <code>fetch()</code> to get the latest value from the <code>/app/net_activity</code> file created in the previous step: <pre><code>function updateActivityLED() {\n  const threshold_bytes = 300;\n  fetch('/app/net_activity')\n    .then(res =&gt; res.text())\n    .then(data =&gt; {\n      const activity = parseInt(data.trim());\n      const leds = document.querySelectorAll('.hostapd-led');\n\n      if (!isNaN(activity)) {\n        leds.forEach(led =&gt; {\n          if (activity &gt; threshold_bytes) {\n            led.classList.add('led-pulse');\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n              led.classList.remove('led-pulse');\n            }, 50);\n          } else {\n            led.classList.remove('led-pulse');\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    })\n    .catch(() =&gt; { /* ignore fetch errors */ });\n}\nsetInterval(updateActivityLED, 100);\n</code></pre> This defines a constant <code>threshold_bytes set to 300</code>.

The <code>network-activity.sh</code> script calculates a composite value based on the observed difference of TX and RX bytes on the interface being monitored.</p> <p>Even on an idle network, small amounts of background multicast or broadcast traffic is often present. This can include things like ARP table maintenance or service advertisement (UPnP, Bonjour, mDNS, ZeroConf, and so on). Blinking an LED for every piece of observed network traffic is excessive and not particularly useful.</p> <p>In testing, a value of 300 bytes seemed to strike a balance and filter low-level network traffic from, say, something a user of RaspAP might generate while connected to the interface.</p> <p>When activity exceeds this threshold value, a class toggle is applied. The <code>setInterval(updateActivityLED, 100)</code> updates at 10 times per second. This isn\u2019t excessive because, 1) the fetch is for a very small file in memory, and 2) the script does minimal parsing and DOM manipulation.</p>"},{"location":"blog/building-a-realtime-network-traffic-led-indicator/#step-6-add-a-dash-of-css","title":"Step 6: Add a dash of CSS","text":"<p>Next, we\u2019ll need new <code>led-pulse</code> and <code>hostapd-led</code> classes to support the JavaScript handler: <pre><code>.led-pulse {\n  opacity: 0.3 !important;\n}\n\n.hostapd-led {\n  color: #28a745;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition: opacity 0.05s;\n}\n</code></pre> This is fairly straightforward; a very short transition between the pulse and default LED state is applied.
